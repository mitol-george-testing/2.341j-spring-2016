  "course_title": "Macromolecular Hydrodynamics",
  "course_description": "The topics cover physical phenomena in polymeric liquids undergoing deformation and flow; kinematics and material functions for complex fluids; techniques of viscometry, rheometry; and linear viscoelastic measurements for polymeric fluids. Also, generalized Newtonian fluids; continuum mechnanics, frame invariance, and convected derivatives for finite strain viscoelasticity; differential and integral constitutive equations for viscoelastic fluids; analytical solutions to isothermal and non-isothermal flow problems; the roles of non-Newtonian viscosity, linear viscoelasticity, normal stresses, elastic recoil, stress relaxation in processing flows; and introduction to molecular theories for dynamics of polymeric fluids. (Extensive class project and presentation required instead of a final exam).\n",
